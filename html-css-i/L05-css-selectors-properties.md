# CSS Properties and Selectors

In this lesson, we will talk about how to use CSS selectors and a few different CSS properties.

One of the keys to styling HTML documents is being able to selectively apply styles to specific elements or groups of elements. In order to do this, something called a CSS selector is used. There are many types of CSS selectors, and advanced selectors can get quite complicated. We will be teaching you the basics so that you can start adding your own style to your pages.

## Basic Selectors

```css
selector {
    property1: value;
    property2: value;
}
```

A style definition starts with a selector. Following the selector is an open and a close curly brace. Inside the curly braces is a list of key:value pairs. As we saw in the last lesson, the key:value pairs have a colon between them, and a semi-colon after them. The key is the name of a CSS property, and the value is the value of the property is being used.

| Selector | Syntax |
|----------|--------|
| Element | The name of the element |
| ID | The name of the id, preceded by a `#` |
| Class | The name of the class, preceded by a `.` |

### Multiple Selectors

If you would like to have multiple selectors have the same style definition, you can separate the selectors with commas as follows:

```css
selector1, selector2 {
    property1: value;
    property2: value;
}
```

### Combining Classes

Often times, you want an HTML element to have several style classes applied. That can be accomplished as follows:

```css
.fancy-header {
    color: blue;
}
.extra-large {
    font-size: 200px;
}
```

```html
<h1 class="fancy-header extra-large">Header Text</h1>
```

In the example above, the `h1` element receives styles from both the `fancy-header` and `extra-large` classes.

### Descendent Selector

Often times, it is useful to apply style to an element or group of elements based on their descendant relationship to some parent element in the page. To create a descendent selector, you first type the parent selector, followed by a space, followed by the descendent selector.

```css
#container h1 {
    color: blue;
}
```

In this example, any `h1` elements that are a descendant of the element with the id of `container` will be blue. Other `h1` elements that are not a descendant of an element with `id="container"` will not receive the style.

### Direct-Child Selector

The direct child selector is similar to the descendent selector except that only direct children of the parent selector will receive the specified style. For the direct-child selector a greater than symbol, `>`, is used in place of the space from the descendent selector.

```css
#container>h1 {
    color: blue;
}
```

In this example, only `h1` elements that are direct children of the element with the id of `container` will be blue.

### Combining Selectors

Sometimes it is useful to combine selectors to be more specific. For example, if the `fancy-header` class is only applicable to `h1` elements, then it can be written as follows:

```css
h1.fancy-header {
    color: blue;
}
```

In the example above, `h1` elements with `class="fancy-header"` will receive the specified style, but other element types with `class="fancy-header"` will not. Combination selectors also allow for customization of properties based on element type. For example:

```css
h1.fancy-header {
    color: blue;
}
h2.fancy-header {
    color: green;
}
```

In this example, you can see that `h1` and `h2` elements will receive different styling through the use of the same class name. Combination of id selectors is not recommended since it might lose the uniqueness purpose of the id selector.

## Pseudo Classes

Pseudo classes can be added to a selector to specify that a particular style should be applied only to a particular state of an element. First, let us see the syntax for a pseudo class with a selector:

```css
selector:pseudo-class {
    property1: value;
    property2: value;
}
```

Notice the colon after the selector, followed by the pseudo-class name. There are many pseudo-classes available in CSS and some of the most commonly used deal with the anchor element.

```css
/* unvisited link (:link) */
a:link {
    color:red;
}

/* visited link (:visited) */
a:visited {
    color:black;
}

/* mouse hover over link (:hover) */
a:hover {
    color:blue;
}

/* active/selected link (:active) */
a:active {
    color:green;
}
```

As you can see, pseudo-classes allow us to style the anchor element based on different states of the link. For a more complete list of available pseudo-classes, look at the [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes).

## Specificity

Due to the cascading nature of style sheets, and the potential for duplicate or conflicting styles being applied to an element, there must be a set of rules that determine what styles actually get applied. The process of deciding what styles get applied is referred to as *specificity*. In general, the more specific the selector, the higher the precedence, the more likely the style will be applied.

## Colors

Often times, you will find yourself applying colors while defining the style of your page. It is worth having a short discussion about how colors work in CSS prior to getting started with properties.

One way to reference a color is simply by using its name. For example, `red` or `blue` are valid colors in CSS. It should be noted that specifying colors by name is not the preferred method and is not something you will see used often. For a list of color names available in CSS look at the [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value).

Another way to reference a color is by using its RGB value, and this is the preferred method. As you may have guessed, RGB stands for Red/Green/Blue. RGB values can be specified in CSS in several ways, but the most common method is by using a six character hexadecimal value. An example of a hex color is `#FFFFFF`, which is the color `white`. Notice how there is a number sign preceding the hexadecimal color value. This is necessary, so do not forget to include it when specifying a color in hexadecimal.

You now know that colors can be specified using a six character hexadecimal value that represents the RGB value of a color. This implies that there are two hex characters for each color. Based on that knowledge, let us look at some example colors:

```css
#FF0000 = red
#00FF00 = green
#0000FF = blue
#000000 = black
#FFFFFF = white
#808080 = grey
```

From the examples above, along with some knowledge of the hexadecimal number system, you can begin to see how hex color codes work. We can also see that since 00-FF represents 256 unique values, we have a total of 256 x 256 x 256 (over 16 million) color combinations.

Besides seeing six character hex color codes, you may also see three character hex color codes. Three character color codes are a shorthand notation that works as follows:

```css
#F00 = #FF0000
#ABC = #AABBCC
#AAA = #AAAAAA
```

## Common CSS Properties and Values

### color

> The CSS `color` property sets the foreground color of an element's text content and its decorations. It does not affect any other characteristic of the element. [More Info](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color).

```css
/* make element text color red */
element { color: #F00; }
```

### text-decoration

> The `text-decoration` CSS property is used to set the text formatting to underline, overline, line-through, or blink. [More Info](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-decoration).

```css
element { text-decoration: underline; }
```

### text-align

> The `text-align` CSS property describes how inline content like text is aligned in its parent block element. text-align does not control the alignment of block elements itself, only their inline content. [More Info](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-align).

```css
element { text-align: center; }
```

### text-indent

> The `text-indent` CSS property specifies how much horizontal space should be left before the beginning of the first line of the text content of an element. Horizontal spacing is with respect to the left (or right, for right-to-left layout) edge of the containing block element's box. [More Info](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-indent).

```css
element { text-indent: 40px; }
```

## Font Properties

### font-family

> The `font-family` CSS property allows for a prioritized list of font family names and/or generic family names to be specified for the selected element. Unlike most other CSS properties, values are separated by a comma to indicate that they are alternatives. The browser will select the first font on the list that is installed on the computer or that can be downloaded using the information provided by a @font-face at-rule.

```css
element { font-family: Helvetica, Arial, Sans-Serif; }
element { font-family: "Times New Roman", Times, Serif; }
element { font-family: "Courier New", Monospace; }
```

You may be curious what the difference is between a serif font, and a sans-serif font. Serifs are the fancy edges/lines that appear on the end of characters. Serif fonts have the fancy edges, sans-serif fonts are "without" serifs. Here is an illustration:

![Example of serif and sans-serif letter A](/img/css/serif-sans-serif.png)

Monospace fonts are a bit different in that all the characters are the same width. Monospace fonts are often used in terminals to help with readability.

More information on font families can be found on the [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-family).

### font-style

> The `font-style` CSS property allows italic or oblique faces to be selected within a font-family. [More Info](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-style).

```css
element { font-style: italic; }
```

### font-size

> The `font-size` CSS property specifies the size of the font â€“ specifically the desired height of glyphs from the font. Setting the font size may, in turn, change the size of other items since it is used to compute the value of em and ex length units.

```css
element { font-size: 12px; }
element { font-size: 1em; }
```

As you can see in the examples above, different units can be used to specify sizes in CSS. Here is a description of the units used above:

- `px` stands for pixels. Pixels are an absolute unit used for screen media.
- `em` is a relative/dynamic unit that corresponds to the current font size. If the current font size is 12px, then 1em is 12px. 2em would be 24px. 0.5 em would be 6px. If the browser font size changes, all em values would change accordingly.

Here is a note regarding pixels from the MDN:

> Note: Defining font sizes in pixel is not accessible, because the user cannot change the font size from the browser. (For example, users with limited vision may wish to set the font size much larger than the size chosen by a web designer.) Therefore, avoid using pixels for font sizes if you wish to create an inclusive design.

To read more about font size specification, look at the [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-size).

### font-weight

> The `font-weight` CSS property specifies the weight or boldness of the font. However, some fonts are not available in all weights; some are available only on normal and bold. [More Info](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-weight).

```css
element { font-weight: bold; }
```

## Background Properties

### background-color

> The `background-color` CSS property sets the background color of an element, either through a color value or the keyword `transparent`. [More Info](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-color).

```css
element { background-color: #F00; }
```

### background-image

> The CSS `background-image` property sets one or several background images for an element. The images are drawn on successive stacking context layers, with the first specified being drawn as if it is the closest to the user. [More Info](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-color).

```css
element { background-image: url("http://www.example.com/images/bck.png"); }
```

### background-repeat

> The `background-repeat` CSS property defines how background images are repeated. A background image can be repeated along the horizontal axis, the vertical axis, both, or not repeated at all. [More Info](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-repeat).

```css
element { background-repeat: repeat-x; }
```

### list-style

> The `list-style` CSS property is a shorthand property for setting list-style-type, list-style-image, and list-style-position. [More Info](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/list-style).

```css
ol { list-style: upper-alpha; }
ul { list-style: square; }
```

## Inheriting Styles

> The `inherit` CSS-value causes the element for which it is specified to take the computed value of the property from its parent element. It is allowed on every CSS property. [More Info](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/inherit).

```css
/* make second-level headers green */
h2 { color: green; }

/* ...but leave those in the sidebar alone so they use their parent's color */
#sidebar h2 { color: inherit; }
```
