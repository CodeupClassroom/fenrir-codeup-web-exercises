- In this exercise we'll build a **responsive site** for a fictional company `Codeup Design` using
   Bootstrap's grid system.
- We are collaborating with the graphic design team and they have given us a **style guide** and 4
   wireframes showing us how the site should look according the device screen size (`xs`, `sm`, `md`
   `lg` and `xl`).

- Extra Small/Small screen:

- This is the style guide we need to follow, it has the sizes, colors, and
   fonts you need to use for this design:

- All the fonts are available at [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). The logo and images
   needed for the site can be downloaded from [here](/examples/bootstrap-grid/assets.zip).
